# Husky Maps

An educational web app for mapping the world, searching for places, and navigating around Seattle. The app is designed to highlight 3 components: [**Autocomplete**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki/Autocomplete), [**Priority Queues**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki/Priority-Queues), and [**Shortest Paths**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki/Shortest-Paths). Each of these components not only implement features in Husky Maps, but also implement 3 other socially-motivated applications of computing: social genomics, content moderation, and seam carving for content-aware image resizing. Check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/wiki) to get started.

The app is designed to support [**Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms**](https://kevinl.info/cs-education-for-the-socially-just-worlds-we-need/), a justice-centered approach to teaching undergraduate data structures and algorithms. The latest courses to use this repository can be found in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/kevinlin1/huskymaps/releases).
